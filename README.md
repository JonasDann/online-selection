# Online Selection
This repository contains an implementation of the online selection algorithm from "Approximate Medians and Other Quantiles in One Pass and with Limited Memory" by Manku et al. Online Selection is the problem of finding quantiles in a stream of data that is larger than memory. Quantiles are the values of elements at a certain position if the sequence was sorted.
